# codeCrowd

Our second group project at the University of Texas coding bootcamp. It is designed to be a study guide and career development tool for web dev bootcampers. The study guide includes a glossary of terms that can be liked for acclaim or flagged for removal. The career development section offers a forum for users to post interview experiences and interview questions they have encountered.
